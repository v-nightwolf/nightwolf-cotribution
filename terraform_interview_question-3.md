179. What are Backends?
A "backend" in Terraform determines how state is loaded and how an operation such as
apply
is executed. This abstraction enables non-local file state storage, remote execution, etc.
By default, Terraform uses the "local" backend, which is the normal behavior of Terraform
180. What is local Backend?
The local backend stores state on the local filesystem, locks that state using system APIs, and performs operations locally.

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 51/72
// Example
terraform {
backend "local" {
path
=
"relative/path/to/terraform.tfstate"
}
}
181. What is the default path for the local backend?
This defaults to "terraform.tfstate" relative to the root module by default.
182. What is State Locking?
If supported by your
backend
, Terraform will lock your state for all operations that could write state. This prevents others from acquiring the lock and potentially corrupting your state.
State locking happens automatically on all operations that could write state. You won't see any message that it is happening. If state locking fails, Terraform will not continue.
183. Does Terraform continue if state locking fails?
No.
If state locking fails, Terraform will not continue.
184. Can you disable state locking?
Yes.
You can disable state locking for most commands with the
-lock
flag but it is not recommended.
185. What are the types of Backend?

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 52/72
Standard:
State management, functionality covered in
State Storage & Locking
Enhanced
: Everything in standard plus
remote operations
.
186. What are remote Backends?
Remote backends allow Terraform to use a shared storage space for state data, so any member of your team can use Terraform to manage the same infrastructure.
187. What is the benefit of using remote backend?
Remote state storage makes collaboration easier and keeps state and secret information off your local disk.
Remote state is loaded only in memory when it is used.
188. If you want to switch from using remote backend to local backend. Whatshould you do?
If you want to move back to local state, you can remove the backend configuration block from your configuration and run
terraform init
again.
Terraform will once again ask if you want to migrate your state back to local.
189. What does the command refresh do?
The
terraform refresh
command is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world infrastructure.
This can be used to detect any drift from the last-known state, and to update the state file.
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 53/72
190. Does the command refresh modify the infrastructure?
The command
refresh
does not modify infrastructure, but does modify the state file.
If the state is changed, this may cause changes to occur during the next plan or apply.
191. How do you backup the state to the remote backend?
1. When configuring a backend for the first time (moving from no defined backend to explicitly configuring one), Terraform will give you the option to migrate your state to the new backend. This lets you adopt backends without losing any existing state.
2. To be extra careful, we always recommend manually backing up your state as well. You can do this by simply copying your
terraform.tfstate
file to another location.
192. What is a partial configuration in terms of configuring Backends?
You do not need to specify every required argument in the backend configuration. Omitting certain arguments may be desirable to avoid storing secrets, such as access keys, within the main configuration. When some or all of the arguments are omitted, we call this a
partial configuration.
193. What are the ways to provide remaining arguments when using partialconfiguration?
Interactively
: Terraform will interactively ask you for the required values, unless interactive input is disabled. Terraform will not prompt for optional values.
File
: A configuration file may be specified via the
init
command line. To specify a file, use the
-backend-config=PATH
option when running
terraform init
. If the file contains secrets it may be kept in a secure data store, such as
Vault
, in which case it must be downloaded to the local disk before running Terraform.
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 54/72
Command-line key/value pairs
: Key/value pairs can be specified via the
init
command line. Note that many shells retain command-line flags in a history file, so this isn't recommended for secrets. To specify a single key/value pair, use the
-backend-config="KEY=VALUE"
option when running
terraform init
.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html
194. What is the basic requirement when using partial configuration?
When using partial configuration, Terraform requires at a minimum that an empty backend configuration is specified in one of the root Terraform configuration files, to specify the backend type
// Example
terraform {
backend "consul" {}
}
195. Give an example of passing partial configuration with Command-lineKey/Value pairs?
terraform init \
-backend-config="address=demo.consul.io" \
-backend-config="path=example_app/terraform_state" \
-backend-config="scheme=https"
196. How to unconfigure a backend?
If you no longer want to use any backend, you can simply remove the configuration from the file. Terraform will detect this like any other change and prompt you to
reinitialize
.
As part of the reinitialization, Terraform will ask if you'd like to migrate your state back down to normal local state. Once this is complete then Terraform is back to behaving as it does by default.
197. How do you encrypt sensitive data in the state?
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 55/72
Terraform Cloud
always encrypts state at rest and protects it with TLS in transit. Terraform Cloud also knows the identity of the user requesting state and maintains a history of state changes. This can be used to control access and track activity.
Terraform Enterprise
also supports detailed audit logging.
The S3 backend supports encryption at rest when the
encrypt
option is enabled. IAM policies and logging can be used to identify any invalid access. Requests for the state go over a TLS connection.
198. Backends are completely optional. Is this true?
Backends are completely optional
. You can successfully use Terraform without ever having to learn or use backends. However, they do solve pain points that afflict teams at a certain scale. If you're an individual, you can likely get away with never using backends.
199. What are the benefits of Backends?
Working in a team
: Backends can store their state remotely and protect that state with locks to prevent corruption. Some backends such as Terraform Cloud even automatically store a history of all state revisions.
Keeping sensitive information off disk
: State is retrieved from backends on demand and only stored in memory. If you’re using a backend such as Amazon S3, the only location the state ever is persisted is in S3.
Remote operations
: For larger infrastructures or certain changes,
terraform apply
can take a long, long time. Some backends support remote operations which enable the operation to execute remotely. You can then turn off your computer and your operation will still complete. Paired with remote state storage and locking above, this also helps in team environments.
200. Why should you be very careful with the Force unlocking the state?
Terraform has a
force-unlock command
to manually unlock the state if unlocking failed.
Be very careful with this command.
If you unlock the state when someone else is holding the lock it could cause multiple writers.
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 56/72
Force unlock should only be used to unlock your own lock in the situation where automatic unlocking failed.
To protect you, the
force-unlock
command requires a unique lock ID. Terraform will output this lock ID if unlocking fails. This lock ID acts as a
nonce
, ensuring that locks and unlocks target the correct lock.
201. You should only use force unlock command when automatic unlocking fails. Isthis true?
True
Read, generate, and modify the configuration

202. How do you define a variable?
variable "region" {
default = "us-east-1"
}
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 57/72
This defines the
region
variable within your Terraform configuration.
203. How do you access the variable in the configuration?
// accessing a variable
provider "aws" {
region =
var.region
}
204. How many ways you can assign variables in the configuration?
Command-line flags
terraform apply -var 'region=us-east-1'
From a file
To persist variable values, create a file and assign variables within this file. Create a file named
terraform.tfvars
with the following contents:
region = "us-east-1"
terraform apply \
-var-file="secret.tfvars" \
-var-file="production.tfvars"
From environment varibles
Terraform will read environment variables in the form of
TF_VAR_name
to find the value for a variable. For example, the
TF_VAR_region
variable can be set in the shell to set the
region
variable in Terraform.
UI input
If you execute
terraform apply
with any variable unspecified, Terraform will ask you to input the values interactively. These values are not saved, but this provides a convenient workflow when getting started with Terraform. UI input is not recommended for everyday use of Terraform.
205. Does environment variables support List and map types?
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 58/72
No
Environment variables can only populate string-type variables. List and map type variables must be populated via one of the other mechanisms.
206. How do you provision infrastructure in a staging environment or a productionenvironment using the same Terraform configuration?
You can use different varible files with the same configuration
// Example
// For development
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
// For test
terraform apply -var-file="test.tfvars"
207. How do you assign default values to variables?
If no value is assigned to a variable via any of these methods and the variable has a
default
key in its declaration, that value will be used for the variable.
variable "region" {
default
= "us-east-1"
}
208. What are the data types for the variables?
string
number
bool
list(<TYPE>)
set(<TYPE>)
map(<TYPE>)
object({<ATTR NAME> = <TYPE>, ... })
tuple([<TYPE>, ...])
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 59/72
209. Give an example of data type List variables?
Lists are defined either explicitly or implicitly.
variable "availability_zone_names" {
type
=
list(string)
default
=
["us-west-1a"]
}
210. Give an example of data type Map variables?
variable "region" {}
variable "amis" {
type = map(string)
}
amis = {
"us-east-1" = "ami-abc123"
"us-west-2" = "ami-def456"
}
// accessing
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
ami = var.amis[var.region]
instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
211. What is the Variable Definition Precedence?
The above mechanisms for setting variables can be used together in any combination. If the same variable is assigned multiple values, Terraform uses the
last
value it finds, overriding any previous values. Note that the same variable cannot be assigned multiple values within a single source.
Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:
* Environment variables
* The
terraform.tfvars
file, if present.
* The
terraform.tfvars.json
file, if present.
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 60/72
* Any
*.auto.tfvars
or
*.auto.tfvars.json
files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
* Any
-var
and
-var-file
options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)
212. What are the output variables?
output variables as a way to organize data to be easily queried and shown back to the Terraform user.
Outputs are a way to tell Terraform what data is important. This data is outputted when
apply
is called, and can be queried using the
terraform output
command.
213. Hoe do you define an output variable?
output "ip" {
value = aws_eip.ip.public_ip
}
Multiple
output
blocks can be defined to specify multiple output variables.
214. How do you view outputs and queries them?
You will see the output when you run the following command
terraform apply
You can query the output with the following command
terraform output
ip
215. What are the dynamic blocks?
some resource types include repeatable
nested blocks
in their arguments, which do not accept expressions
You can dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks like
setting
using a special
dynamic
block type, which is supported inside
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium

resource
,
data
,
provider
, and
provisioner
blocks:
A
dynamic
block acts much like a
for
expression, but produces nested blocks instead of a complex typed value. It iterates over a given complex value, and generates a nested block for each element of that complex value.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#dynamic-blocks
example using dynamic blocks
216. What are the best practices for dynamic blocks?
Overuse of
dynamic
blocks can make configuration hard to read and maintain, so we recommend using them only when you need to hide details in order to build a clean user interface for a re-usable module.
Always write nested blocks out literally where possible.
217. What are the Built-in Functions?
The Terraform language includes a number of built-in functions that you can call from within expressions to transform and combine values.

218. Does Terraform language support user-defined functions?
No
The Terraform language does not support user-defined functions, and so only the functions built in to the language are available for use.
219. What is the built-in function to change string to a number?
parseint
parses the given string as a representation of an integer in the specified base and returns the resulting number. The base must be between 2 and 62 inclusive.

}
222. What is Resource Address?
A
Resource Address
is a string that references a specific resource in a larger infrastructure. An address is made up of two parts:
[module path][resource spec]
223. What is the Module path?
A module path addresses a module within the tree of modules. It takes the form:
module.A.module.B.module.C...
Multiple modules in a path indicate nesting. If a module path is specified without a resource spec, the address applies to every resource within the module. If the module path is omitted, this addresses the root module.
224. What is the Resource spec?
A resource spec addresses a specific resource in the config. It takes the form:
resource_type.resource_name[resource index]
*
resource_type
- Type of the resource being addressed.
*
resource_name
- User-defined name of the resource.
*
[resource index]
- an optional index into a resource with multiple instances, surrounded by square brace characters (
[
and
]
).

{
"terraform": "value1",
"resource": "value2",
"indexing": "value3",
"example": "value4",
}
}
aws_instance.web["example"] //
Refers to only the "example" instance in the config.
225. What are complex types and what are the collection types Terraform supports?
A
complex
type is a type that groups multiple values into a single value.
There are two categories of complex types:
collection types (for grouping similar values)
*
list(...)
: a sequence of values identified by consecutive whole numbers starting with zero.
*
map(...)
: a collection of values where each is identified by a string label.
*
set(...)
: a collection of unique values that do not have any secondary identifiers or ordering.
structural types (for grouping potentially dissimilar values).
*
object(...)
: a collection of named attributes that each have their own type.
*
tuple(...)
: a sequence of elements identified by consecutive whole numbers starting with zero, where each element has its own type.
226. What are the named values available and how do we refer to?
Terraform makes several kinds of named values available. Each of these names is an expression that references the associated value; you can use them as standalone expressions, or combine them with other expressions to compute new values.
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 65/72
*
<RESOURCE TYPE>.<NAME>
is an object representing a
managed resource
of the given type and name. The attributes of the resource can be accessed using
dot or square bracket notation
.
*
var.<NAME>
is the value of the
input variable
of the given name.
*
local.<NAME>
is the value of the
local value
of the given name.
*
module.<MODULE NAME>.<OUTPUT NAME>
is the value of the specified
output value
from a
child module
called by the current module.
*
data.<DATA TYPE>.<NAME>
is an object representing a
data resource
of the given data source type and name. If the resource has the
count
argument set, the value is a list of objects representing its instances. If the resource has the
for_each
argument set, the value is a map of objects representing its instances.
*
path.module
is the filesystem path of the module where the expression is placed.
*
path.root
is the filesystem path of the root module of the configuration.
*
path.cwd
is the filesystem path of the current working directory. In normal use of Terraform this is the same as
path.root
, but some advanced uses of Terraform run it from a directory other than the root module directory, causing these paths to be different.
*
terraform.workspace
is the name of the currently selected
workspace
.

231. What is Sentinel?
Sentinel
is an embedded policy-as-code framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products. It enables fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions, and can be extended to use information from external sources.
232. What is the benefit of Sentinel?

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 67/72
Codifying policy removes the need for ticketing queues, without sacrificing enforcement.
One of the other benefits of Sentinel is that it also has a full testing framework.
Avoiding a ticketing workflow allows organizations to provide more self-service capabilities and end-to-end automation, minimizing the friction for developers and operators.

233. What is the Private Module Registry?
Terraform Cloud's private module registry helps you share
Terraform modules
across your organization. It includes support for module versioning, a searchable and filterable list of available modules, and a configuration designer to help you build new workspaces faster.
234. What is the difference between public and private module registries whendefined source?
The public registry uses a three-part
<NAMESPACE>/<MODULE NAME>/<PROVIDER>
format
private modules use a four-part
<HOSTNAME>/<ORGANIZATION>/<MODULE NAME>/<PROVIDER>
format
// example
module "vpc" {

238. You are configuring a remote backend in the terraform cloud. You didn’t createan organization before you do terraform init. Does it work?
While the organization defined in the backend stanza
must
already exist,
239. You are configuring a remote backend in the terraform cloud. You didn’t createa workspace before you do terraform init. Does it work?
Terraform Cloud will create it if necessary. If you opt to use a workspace that already exists, the workspace must not have any existing states.
240. Terraform workspaces when you are working with CLI and Terraformworkspaces in the Terraform cloud. Is this correct?
If you are familiar with running Terraform using the CLI, you may have used Terraform workspaces. Terraform Cloud workspaces behave differently than Terraform CLI workspaces. Terraform CLI workspaces allow multiple state files to exist within a single directory, enabling you to use one configuration for multiple environments. Terraform Cloud workspaces contain everything needed to manage a given set of infrastructure, and function like separate working directories.

242. You are building infrastructure on your local machine and you changed yourbackend to remote backend with the Terraform cloud. What should you do tomigrate the state to the remote backend?
terraform init
Once you have authenticated the
remote
backend, you're ready to migrate your local state file to Terraform Cloud. To begin the migration, reinitialize. This causes Terraform to recognize your changed backend configuration.
During reinitialization, Terraform presents a prompt saying that it will copy the state file to the new backend. Enter "yes" and Terraform will migrate the state from your local machine to Terraform Cloud.

244. What is Run Triggers?
Terraform Cloud’s run triggers allow you to link workspaces so that a successful apply in a source workspace will queue a run in the workspace linked to it with a run trigger.
For example, adding new subnets to your network configuration could trigger an update to your application configuration to rebalance servers across the new subnets.
245. What is the benefit of Run Triggers?
When managing complex infrastructure with Terraform Cloud, organizing your configuration into different workspaces helps you to better manage and design your infrastructure.
Configuring run triggers between workspaces allows you to set up infrastructure pipelines as part of your overall deployment strategy.
246. What are the available permissions that terraform clouds can have?
Terraform Cloud teams can have read, plan, write, or admin permissions on individual workspaces.
247. Who can grant permissions on the workspaces?
Organization owners grant permissions by grouping users into teams and giving those teams priviliges based on their need for access to individual workspaces.
