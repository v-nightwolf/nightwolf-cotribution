           At the beginning of the session if you use 'script' command then the details of the input and output
           commands will be saved in a file called typescript and we can view it any time using “cat typescript”
           command.
           This is very useful to track what user is doing what. HISTORY command will not work because it shows
           data only for the current session.

       52. How to create a file in Unix?
           There are multiple way to create files in unix, but the simple way to create a file is using “cat” and

           Yes TOP command it self has a command prompt. Type K then it will ask you for the PID of the process to
           kill. Hit the PID and enter, it will kill the process.

       56. What is the difference between creating a file in cat and in touch command?
           cat command creates a file and we can save some data inside the file but touch command by default will
           create a blank file.

           runs in the backend and gives you the output.
           We can view the C program as well as below.
           type <Command Name> ->hit enter, it will give you a path where the program the command is located.

              # chkconfig <service name> on
              # chkconfig <service name> –level 3

       119. Explained BOOT LOADER?
            The boot loader is then responsible for loading the kernel.
            A boot loader finds the kernel image on the disk, loads it into memory, starts it.
            Stage 1 boot loader:
                First stage the primary boot loader is to find and load the secondary boot loader.
                It will find by looking through the partition table for an active partition.
                This is verified methos to the active partition’s boot record is read from the device into RAM and
                executed.

            Stage 2 boot loader
                The second-stage, boot loader called the kernel loader.
                The first- and second-stage boot loaders combined are calledGRand Unified Bootloader.
                With stage 2 loaded, GRUB can display a list of available kernels You can select a kernel parameters.

       120. Explained about File System Labels?
            File system labels are useful where you need to address the file system that is on the device.
            The file system label is set, you can use it when mounting the device.
            The name replace to device by LABEL=labelname to do this

            To add a lable on ext3 filesystems
            # mkfs.ext4 -L mylabel /dev/sda2
 
            To add a lable on exitsting filesystems
            # tune2fs -L mylabel /dev/sda2

       121. To convert ext2 to ext3 filesystem?
            # tune2fs -j /dev/hda4 => Do it on your own risk. I would recommend to create a new filesystem of ext3 
              and copy the data from ext2 to ext3. 

       122. To convert ext3 to ext2 filesystem?
            # tune2fs -O^has-journal /dev/hda1 => Do it on your own risk. I would recommend to create a new 
              filesystem of ext2 and copy the data from ext3 to ext2.

       123. To convert ext2 to ext4 filesystem?
            # tune2fs -O dir_index,has_journal,uninit_bg /dev/hdXX
            # e2fsck -pf /dev/hdXX

       124. To convert ext3 to ext4 filesystem?
            umount /dev/sda2
            tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda2
            e2fsck -pf /dev/sda2
            mount /dev/sda2 /home

       125. Explained Hash Tables?
            The bash shell maintains a hash table for each command which has been run. The reason, why it does so
            is, making the commands run faster.
            Whenever, a user runs a command on the shell, it first has to search the command executable as to where
            is it located.
            whenever the first time bash shell, finds the location of a command executable, it adds it to a hash table.
            The next time, same command is run,
            the path is taken from the hash table rather than searched again making the commands run faster.
             # hash
              hitscommand
              7 /bin/grep
              1 /usr/bin/which
              1 /usr/bin/touch
              
           Reset the hash table
            # hash -r

           Delete the corresponding entry
            # hash -d myprint

       126. Following the program will not affected by this shell /sbin/nologin?
            FTP clients
            mail clients
            sudo
            many setuid programs
            telnet/login
            gdm/kdm/xdm (graphical login)
            su

       127. So how do I find out zombie process?
            # ps aux | awk ‘{ print $8 ” ” $2 }’ | grep -w Z
            Output:
             Z 4104
             Z 5320
             Z 2945

       128. How do I kill zombie process?
            ps axo ppid,stat | grep Z | awk ‘{print $1}’ | xargs kill -HUP
            kill -HUP $(ps -A -ostat,ppid | grep -e ‘[zZ]’| awk ‘{ print $2 }’)
            kill -9 $(ps -A -ostat,ppid | grep -e ‘[zZ]’| awk ‘{ print $2 }’)
       
       129. Details about Backup?
           • full – as the name implies, this is a backup of everything
           • differential – this is a backup of everything since the last full backup
           • incremental – this is a backup of everything since the last _incremental_ backup

             This command will create a backup of /home and put that in the file /tmp/home.tar
             # tar -cvf /tmp/home.tar /home

            Create a backup of the directories /home /var /root and write that to the file /tmp/system-backup.tar
            # tar -cvf /tmp/system-backup.tar /home /var /root

            The following command makes a backup of /home and writes that to the /dev/mt0 device
            # tar -cvf /dev/mt0 /home

       130. To create a compressed archive of the directory /home
            # tar -zcvf /tmp/home.tar.gz /home
            # tar -jcvf /tmp/home.tar.bz2 /home

       131. Extracts the contents of the compressed file
            # tar -zxvf /file.tar.gz
            # tar -jxvf /file.tar.bz2

       132. To check the contents of a tar file
            # tar -tvf file.tgz

       133. Making Device Backups Using dd
            # dd if=/etc/hosts of=/home/somefile
            # dd if=/etc/passwd of=/home/file1
            # dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096
            # dd if=backup.tar.gz of=/dev/mt0

       134. To save MBR file backup as boot files in tmp directory
            # dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/bootfiles bs=512 count=1

       135. Determining Filesystem Usage:
            To determine how much disk space is being used for a given partition, logical volume, or
            NFS mount, use the df command.To display the output in “human readable” format, use the -h argument
            to df.
            The du command displays the disk usage totals for each subdirectory and finally the total usage for
            the current directory.Values are in kilobytes.
            # du -hs /etc
            # du -h /vol1/group1/examplefile

       136. Reporting Disk Performance:
            For example, if the access time for a drive suddenly drops, an administrator
            must quickly start troubleshooting the problem to determine if it is a software or hardware issue or
            simply due to lack of free space on the disk.

       137. Displaying Memory Usage with free
            # free -m
            The free command tells you about current memory usage.
            Two types of system memory exist: physical and virtual. To display the amount of free and used memory,
            both physical and virtual (swap), use the free command

       138. Monitoring and Tuning the Kernel:
            Using the /proc Directory
            Instead of executing utilities such as free and top to determine the status of system resources or fdisk
            to view disk partitions, an administrator can gather system information directly from the kernel through
            the /proc filesystem.
            When you view the contents of files in /proc, you are really asking the kernel what the current state is
            for that particular device or subsystem. To view the contents of a special file in /proc, use the cat, 
            less or more file viewing utilities.

       139. Network Information Service (NIS)
            NIS can have only one authoritative server where the original data files are kept
            This authoritative server is called the master NIS server. If your organization is large enough, you may
            need to distribute the load across more than one machine. This can be done by setting up one or more
            secondary (slave) NIS servers.
            # echo “NISDOMAIN=nis.nightwolf.in” >> /etc/sysconfig/network

            # ypserv
              This daemon runs on the NIS server. It listens for queries from clients and responds with answers to
              those queries.

            # ypxfrd
              This daemon is used for propagating and transferring the NIS databases to slave servers.

            # ypbind
              This is the client-side component of NIS. It is responsible for finding an NIS server to be queried
              for information. The ypbind daemon binds NIS clients to an NIS domain. It must be running on any 
              machines running NIS client programs.

       140. Main config file for Yum Server in linux
            # cat /etc/yum.conf

            # mdadm –query –detail /dev/md0
            # cat /proc/mdstat

       155. To create RAID disk
            # mdadm –create /dev/md0 -l 1 -n 3 /dev/sda{5,6,7}
            # mdadm –create /dev/md0 -l 1 -n 3 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc -x 2 /dev/sdd

       156. To create RAID disk with spare disk

            # vgcreate datavg /dev/md0
            # lvcreate -L +1G -n /dev/datavg/datalv

       158. Disk Failure on RAID
            To simulate a disk failure, we’ll use mdadm to tell the kernel that /dev/sdb1 has failed
            # mdadm –manage /dev/md0 –fail /dev/sda7
            # cat /proc/mdstat
              sda7 [F]

       161. To quickly check the state of all your RAID arrays
            # cat /proc/mdstat

       162. userlist_enable vsftpd
            Will load a list of usernames from the filename specified by the userlist_file directive when this
            option is enabled. And if a user tries to log in using a name in this file, that user will be denied 
            access before even being prompted for a password. The default value is NO.

       163. userlist_deny
            This option is examined if the userlist_enable option is active. When its value is set to NO, users 
            will be denied login, unless they are explicitly listed in the file specified by userlist_file. When
            login is denied, the denial is issued before the user is asked for a password; this helps prevent users
            from sending clear text across the network. The default value is YES.

       163. userlist_file
            This option specifies the name of the file to be loaded when the userlist_enable option is active. The
            default value is vsftpd.user_list.

       164. download_enable
            If set to NO, all download requests will be denied permission. The default value is YES.

       165. write_enable
            This option controls whether any FTP commands that change the file system are allowed.
             These commands are used STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE.
             The default value is NO.

       166. UserDir
            This directive defines the subdirectory within each user’s home directory, where users
            can place personal content that they want to make accessible via the web server. This
            directory is usually named public_html and is usually stored under each user’s home
            directory. This option is, of course, dependent on the availability of the mod_userdir
            module in the web server setup.
            A sample usage of this option in the httpd.conf file is
            UserDir disable
            UserDir public_html

       167. ErrorDocument
            The ErrorDocuments directive lets you specify what happens when a client asks for  nonexistent document.
            Specifies a file that the server sends when an error of a specific type occurs. You can also provide a
            text message for an error. Here are some examples:
            ErrorDocument 403 “Sorry, you cannot access this directory”
            ErrorDocument 403 /error/noindex.html
            ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_link.pl
            ErrorDocument 401 /new_subscriber.htm
