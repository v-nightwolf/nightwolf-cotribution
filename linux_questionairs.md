	1. Explain the below error: 

		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		find: page allocation failure. order:5, mode:0x0
		Pid: 22938, comm: find Not tainted 2.6.32-279.el6.i686 #1
		Call Trace:
	 	[<c04f22bc>] ? __alloc_pages_nodemask+0x6bc/0x870
	 	[<c051f1bc>] ? cache_alloc_refill+0x2bc/0x510
	 	[<c083f035>] ? apic_timer_interrupt+0x31/0x38
	 	[<c051f552>] ? __kmalloc+0x142/0x180
	 	[<f7fdb1d6>] ? rpc_malloc+0x36/0x90 [sunrpc]
	 	[<f7fdb1d6>] ? rpc_malloc+0x36/0x90 [sunrpc]
	 	[<f7fdb2f0>] ? rpc_wait_bit_killable+0x0/0x80 [sunrpc] 
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	   Hint =>
			Above error is kernel dump due to kmalloc buffer exhaustion. The system is out of memory and 
			cannot satisfy the allocation request at all. This is more likely to happen on swap-less systems
			that are unable to purge application pages to free up memory.
			The system may have sufficient free pages in total but not enough that are physically contiguous
			to satisfy the allocation request. This is referred to as memory fragmentation.

			- The phrase "page allocation failure" - this defines the error message that should be used in a 
			  KCS search.
			- The process name "find" - often page allocation failures are related to code that gets executed
			  by specific threads, try searching KCS with and without this term. If the allocation request was
			  performed by an interrupt service routine then the process name will be irrelevant.
			- The order of the allocation "order:5" and mode "mode:0x0" can often be the same for every instance
			  of a particular problem, try searching KCS with and without these terms.
			- The function requesting the memory allocation "rpc_malloc()" is likely to be the same for every 
			  instance of this particular problem so include that in the KCS search.
			- Do not search for the CPU number, the process id or function offsets since they will change and
			  may prevent finding a match.

	2. What is order:5, mode:0x0 in above output.

	3. Difference between kernel panic due to Memory crunch and page allocation failure.

	4. Difference between VMalloc and KMalloc
	   Hint =>
			The kmalloc() & vmalloc() functions are a simple interface for obtaining kernel memory in byte-sized
			chunks.

			- The kmalloc() function guarantees that the pages are physically contiguous (and virtually contiguous).
			- The vmalloc() function works in a similar fashion to kmalloc(), except it allocates memory that is 
			  only virtually contiguous and not necessarily physically contiguous.

	41. What are the inodes and how will you free up them? 

	42. How can we check the packet flow in our system? 

	43. what is the steal value in top command? 	

	44. Explain what is NUMA. You may know this as "Node Interleaving”. Give an example
	    where NUMA is beneficial, and another where it's detrimental.
	    Hints =>
		a). NUMA: Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a design where the memory is split into
		    groups by CPU, making the memory access faster for each CPU to their memory group.
		b). Beneficial: Multiple processes with smaller memory footprints. Good for applications that fork
		     processes, like Apache.
		    Detrimental: Monolithic, memory-heavy, single processes. May be threaded, example MySQL, Redis,
		    Java-everything, Memcached.
		Follow-Up Q. - what if there's only a single physical proc.

	45. Customer complains that their CPUs aren't running as fast as they're rated. How would you Troubleshoot ?
	    Hints => 
		a). Could be heat damage - check /proc/cpuinfo for "cpu MHz".
		b). Could be the wrong CPUs installed, for that matter. Check the CPU specs in /proc/cpuinfo. OR dmidecode.
		c). Get 'em to tell you how to fix it (Change system profile to MaximumPerformance with omconfig, then reboot)

	46. Can we check System logs on Hardware layer from OS ?How ?
	    Hints =>
		a). Yes, in dmesg logs or kern.log
		b). By using respective Hardware CLI commands.
		c). Specific answers
			hpasmcli -s "show iml"  ==> For HP servers
			omreport system [alertlog | esmlog]   ==> For Dell Servers

	47. What can be done to improve the performance of an I/O-heavy system?
	    Hints =>
		a). Check RAID Level, if server using any.
		b). Partition aligned, i.e. starting a partition on sector 2048.
		c). Mount Options like: noatime - (covers norelatime/nodiratime) Can be enabled only via fstab.
		d). RAID Controller settings - read/write policy, e.g. write-through(good to ensure data has been changed on disk.
		    write-back(relys on cache, battery).
		e). nobarrier - depends on whether or not the PERC Controller is making use of a battery or not.
		f). Adjust the filesystem journaling method - the default mount option is in the middle, data=ordered. 
		    This indicates the data is written out to the filesystem before the metadata in the journal is updated. 
		    The filesystem can be mounted with data=writeback which allows data to be written to the journal and 
		    disk at the same time, with the risk of some data possibly being written to the disk after the metadata 
		    that cannot be recovered after a crash. Additionally, the journal can be placed on an external device 
		    with another mount option, allowing separation of the writes to increase throughput performance for 
		    each write operation.
		g). discard - For SSDs. Also called fs TRIM. Extends life and improves performance of SSD drives. 
		    TRIM enables the controller to cache the expected SSD write cycles to collapse them into a "do only once" 
		    mechanism to prevent burning out the SSD cells, which can only be written to once with voltage.
			Note: For LVM, set issue_discards=1 in lvm.conf.
			Note: On Dell, TRIM/discard is only available on RAID controllers >= PERC H710
		h). For SSD, you don't want controller caching for performance reasons. By default HPs turn caching off.
		    Dell: Cut-through IO (CTIO) is an IO accelerator for SSD arrays that boosts the throughput of devices
		    connected to the PERC Controller. It is enabled through disabling the write-back cache (enable writethrough
		    cache) and disabling Read Ahead.
		    HP: On servers with SSD drives, write caching appears to be disabled by default for performance reasons 
		    (there is no need for write caching on SSD drives which are fast enough). Writes to SSD drives will not 
		    be acknowledged until the data is actually written to disk:
		i). On HP, HP SSD Smart Path - this is enabled by default by the RAID creation process in the HP RAID controller
		    itself, and can be checked with the standard commands using hpssacli to view controller details and RAID
		    logical device details. The theory is this special method of SSD writing replaces traditional caching 
		    techniques with a special HP invented method for improving SSD performance and longevity.
		j). Disk IO Scheduler
			deadline (recommended for DBs)
			noop (recommended for VMs)


	48. Why would I choose to use RAID-5 instead of RAID-10? Or vice versa?
	    Hints => 
		RAID-5:
			Pro: Space efficiency - you only sacrifice 1x HDD to redundancy.
			Pro: Possible with a minimum of 3x drives, as opposed to RAID-10's minimum-4.
			Con: Slow writes. Note: Reads are still quick though, so you'd be fine on a read-heavy application.
			Con: If two drives fail, you lose everything.
		RAID-10:
			Pro: Great performance with both reads and writes. Good for write-heavy applications.
			Pro: Less risk of a catastrophic failure, since more than 1 drive can fail safely (Note: Depends which
			     drives).
			Con: Too much wastage of Space. Only 50% capacity is uasable.

	49. How snapshots work ? Can you please explain. In terms of VMWare or LVM(in case someone asks).
	    Hints => 
		As soon as you create a snapshot, LVM creates a pool of blocks. This pool also contains a full copy of the
		LVM metadata of the volume. When writes happen to the main volume such as updating an inode, the block being 
		overwritten is copied to this new pool and the new block is written to the main volume. This is the 'copy-on-write'.
		Because of this, the more data that gets changed between when a snapshot was taken and the current state of 
		the main volume, the more space will get consumed by that snapshot pool.
		When you mount the snapshot, the meta-data written when the snapshot was taken allows the mapping of snapshot 
		pool blocks over changed blocks in the volume (or higher level snapshot). This way when an access comes for a
		specific block, LVM knows which block access. As far as the filesystem on that volume is concerned, there are
		no snapshots.

	50. In which scenario we need to use vgcfgrestore and vgcfgbackup commands ? When /etc/lvm/archive contents are 
	    written (when does backup happen ?)
	    Hints =>
			a). To restore VG configuration.
			b). Backup is taken whenever we make change to LVM (create/remove LV/VG) and we can use it to restore 
		    	to the prior state.

	51. What is default signal sent by KILL command ?
	    Hint =>
			a). singnal 15 (SIGTERM) is sent by default if you do not specify the signal type. 

	52. What is deadlock ? How to identify if process is in deadlock in Linux/Unix ?
	    Hint =>
			Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource
			and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process

	53. How to load kernel module. any commands ?
	    Hint => 
			We can use "modprobe" or "insmod" commands to load kernel module.	

	54. Difference between insmod and modprobe commands in Linux ?


	55. Different types of file systems?
	    Hint =>
			ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, vfat etc.

	56. Difference between ext4 and xfs?

	57. When v create user which files are referred?

	58. Differnce between passwd and shadow file?
	    Hint => 
			/etc/passwd contains User's detail like home directory, shell etc.
			/etc/shadow conatains User's password hashes. 

	59. What are the contents in passwd file?
	    Hint =>
			root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

		       •   login name
		       •   optional encrypted password
		       •   numerical user ID
		       •   numerical group ID
		       •   user name or comment field
		       •   user home directory
		       •   optional user command interpreter

	60. List all users who are not given passwd? with cmd
	    Hint =>
			cat /etc/shadow| awk -F ":" '$2 ~ /[a-z]/ {print $1}'
	
	61. How to check what processess are running on which port?
	    Hint =>
			Using "netstat" and "ss" command we can relate processes with port. 

	62. How to extend partition in lvm? and indepth questions in lvm ?
	    Hint => 
			1. First attach extra storage/disk to server. 
			2. Create a new partition on the disk using 'fdisk' or 'parted' command. 
			3. Create a new Physical Volume(PV) on that new partition. e.g. 'pvcreate /dev/sdb1'		
			4. Exetend existing Volume Group(VG) using new PV. e.g. 'vgextend vg_name /dev/sdb1'
			5. Now extend the LV. e.g . 'lvextend -l 100%FREE /dev/mapper/vg_name-lv_name'
			6. now execute 'resize2fs' or 'xfs_growfs'.

	63. What is tcpwrappers?
	    Hint =>
			tcpwrappers is a host based Network Access Control List, by which we can allow or deny 
			a host or subnetwork IP addresses, 

	64. On which port dns works?
	    Hint =>
			DNS works on port 53.
