Absolutely, here are some common Python coding interview questions often encountered during interviews at top technology companies (FAANG), formatted in markdown:

1. **Two Sum:**
   Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target number.

2. **Reverse a String:**
   Write a function to reverse a string.

3. **Palindrome:**
   Determine whether a given string is a palindrome.

4. **FizzBuzz:**
   Print numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

5. **Valid Parentheses:**
   Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

6. **Merge Intervals:**
   Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.

7. **Maximum Subarray:**
   Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum.

8. **Longest Common Prefix:**
   Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

9. **Reverse Linked List:**
   Reverse a singly linked list.

10. **Binary Tree Traversal:**
    Implement different types of binary tree traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder.

11. **Validate BST:**
    Determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

12. **Word Search:**
    Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

13. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree:**
    Serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

14. **LRU Cache:**
    Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.

15. **String to Integer (atoi):**
    Implement the atoi function, which converts a string to an integer.

16. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree):**
    Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

17. **Rotate Array:**
    Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

18. **Intersection of Two Arrays:**
    Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

19. **Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array:**
    Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

20. **Merge k Sorted Lists:**
    Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
