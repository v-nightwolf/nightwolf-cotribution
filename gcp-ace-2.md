1. You want to run a Kubernetes cluster for a high availability set of applications. What type of cluster would you use?

        a). Multi-regional
        b). Single zone
        c). Regional
        d). Multi-zonal

        Correct: c

        Explanation:
            Regional clusters have replicas of the control plane while single zone and multi-zonal clusters
            have only one control plane. There is no such thing as multi-regional cluster.

2. A large enterprise has created multiple organizations in GCP. They would like to connect
the VPC networks across organizations. What should they do?

        a). Implement a Shared VPC
        b). Implement VPC Network Peering between VPCs
        c). Implement a VPN between VPCs
        d). Define firewall rules to allow egress traffic to other VPC networks

        Correct: b

        Explanation:
            Since the connected networks are in different organizations, they must use VPC Network
            Peering. VPC sharing is only available within a single organization. Firewall rule changes may
            be needed, but that is not sufficient. VPNs are used to connect GCP networks with on premises
            networks.
